Sony STR-DH190 Receiver Controller
----------------------------------

Just a simple arduino-based device to set my receiver to the proper input and volume level when I turn my desktop computer on (in case the receiver was in some other mode like bluetooth). It does with by acting like the remote control that came with the receiver.
